    "For this project I decided I wanted to explore the restaurant scene in places I've lived in the past. I decided to explore the cities of Austin, Houston, and San Antonio to get a better glimpse into potential suggestions for investors and entrepreneurs looking to make a sound investment in restauranteering. I was looking for what type of restaurant would be the best and in which city to focus on when scouting for potential property.\n",

    "The question we attempted to address by conducting this project was to discern how accurately we can predict the amount of \"likes\" a new restaurant opening in this region can expect to have based on the type of cuisine it will serve and which city in TexaS it will open in. For this project I analyzed and modeled the data using machine learning by comparing both linear and logistic regressions to see which method yielded better predictive capabilities after training and testing."
